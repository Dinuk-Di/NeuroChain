### **Decentralized AI Model Provenance & Integrity**

**NeuroChain** is a Web3-powered ecosystem designed to solve the "black box" problem of AI provenance. By leveraging the **Ethereum** blockchain, NeuroChain provides an immutable ledger for registering AI models, verifying their cryptographic integrity (SHA-256), and ensuring that authorship is cryptographically signed and verifiable.

## 🏗️ The Architecture

NeuroChain moves away from simulated ledgers to a real-world **DApp (Decentralized Application)** architecture.

* **Smart Contract** : Written in Solidity, deployed via Hardhat. It handles model registry and collision prevention.
* **Provider** : Ethers.js connects the browser to the Ethereum network.
* **Signer** : MetaMask handles the private keys and transaction authorization.
* **Integrity** : SHA-256 hashing ensures that even a single bit change in the AI model file results in a failed verification.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| **Layer**        | **Technology**  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Blockchain**   | Solidity, Hardhat     |
| **Frontend**     | React.js, TailwindCSS |
| **Web3 Library** | Ethers.js (v6)        |
| **Wallet**       | MetaMask              |
| **Environment**  | Node.js, Dotenv       |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
* [MetaMask Extension](https://metamask.io/) installed in your browser.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

**Bash**

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd NeuroChain
npm install
```

### 3. Spin up Local Blockchain

Start the Hardhat node to simulate the Ethereum network locally. This will provide you with 20 test accounts.

**Bash**

```
npx hardhat node
```

### 4. Deploy Smart Contract

In a new terminal window, deploy the contract to your local network:

**Bash**

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

> **Note** : Copy the deployed contract address from the terminal and paste it into your `frontend/src/config.js` file.

## 🔌 Smart Contract Logic

The core logic resides in `NeuroChain.sol`. It ensures that:

1. **Uniqueness** : A model's SHA-256 hash cannot be registered twice.
2. **Authorship** : The `msg.sender` (wallet address) is permanently linked to the registration event.
3. **Timestamping** : Uses the block's timestamp for verified "Proof of Existence."

**Solidity**

```
function registerModel(string memory _name, string memory _author, string memory _modelHash) public {
    require(!hashExists[_modelHash], "Model already registered!");
    // ... logic to store model
}
```

## 💻 Running the Demo

1. **Connect MetaMask** : Switch your MetaMask network to `Localhost 8545` (Chain ID `31337`).
2. **Import Account** : Import one of the private keys generated by `npx hardhat node` into MetaMask.
3. **Start Frontend** :
   **Bash**

```
   cd frontend
   npm start
```

1. **Register a Model** : Upload an AI model file (e.g., `.onnx`, `.pth`). The frontend will compute the SHA-256 hash locally, and MetaMask will pop up to sign the transaction to write this data to the blockchain.
